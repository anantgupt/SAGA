0. Simulate all protocols analysis using script_all1_test.py (set N_avg as desired, default value is 50). This will create folders for Fig 3-12.
1. Run gen_ploty.py inside paper_plots folder to generate the plots (It copies and runs create_fig... scripts to respective folders. Also copies Nob-snr results for NOMP from OSPA directory to Fig_9_DFT directory to avoid repeated simulations).
3. Remember to set Navg correctly while plotting paper plots (Default 50 in simulation and plotting scripts). Otherwise the runtime, no. of operations plots will be incorrect.
