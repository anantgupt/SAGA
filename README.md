# SAGA (Spatial data association using Geometric Assistance)
This repo provides the code for using SAGA algorithm to perform Multi-Sensor, Multi-target association of range-doppler measurements.
Our proposed algorithm performs rapid association of measurements over a linear array of sensors by exploiting geometric features.

Example scripts in the TSPsimpack folder evaluate the performance of core algorithm for different system setting.
